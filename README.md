# rucovidr

rucovidr is a small package that makes scraping Russian COVID-19 data (relatively) easy. 

It's not documented particularly well, but fortune favours the bold, so don't hesitate to run the scrapers - just be aware that it scrapes hundreds of pages every function call, so it might take a while and sometimes time out.

## Installation

You can install rucovidr with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("naturewillconfess/rucovidr")
```
